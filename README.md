# Project-one

As part of your assessment, you are to design the www.bbc.com webpage. Just the homepage (the first page you see).

### Project Goal
To see how well you understand the following:  

- HTML elements  
- HTML containers/the Bootstrap grid system,  
- Styling, and  
- GIT.

### Project Submission
The project week has begun. The project duration is until the end of this course week. You are expected to:  
    - Fork the https://github.com/axp2-0/project-one.git project.  
    - Create a new branch.  
    - The branch name must be “your BID”-BBC, example 103GH-BBC  
    - Start/Move your project there.  
    - Add, commit, and  
    - Push your code to the repository.  
    - Add your mentor as a reviewer for review.  
    - When you are done, set up GITHUB pages to host your files.  
    - Share work with everyone on the SLACK channel #project_one  

### Project Assessment
Individual projects will be judged by all members of the faculty during a general review on Saturday by 1pm.
Achieving the task and the quality of your code are the highest bases of judgement.

Remember that this will form part of your general assessment, 
and participating in the Advance track is dependent on how well you perform in this track, 
however whoever performs best would get an **A-XPerience T-shirt SWAG**.
